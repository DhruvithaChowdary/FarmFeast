        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>FarmFeast</strong>, where we bridge the gap between farmers and customers, ensuring fresh, organic produce reaches your table while empowering farmers with fair prices.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>At FarmFeast, we are committed to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eliminating Middlemen</strong>: By connecting farmers directly with customers, we ensure farmers receive fair prices for their hard work, and you get the freshest produce at affordable rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Promoting Healthy Living</strong>: We categorize vegetables based on their nutritional value—carbs, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and fiber—to help you make informed choices.</li>
            <li><strong>Supporting Busy Lifestyles</strong>: We understand that modern families are busy. With FarmFeast, you no longer need to worry about finding time to shop for fresh vegetables. We deliver them straight to your door.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Choose FarmFeast?</h2>
        <p>Here’s what makes us unique:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fresh and Organic</strong>: All our vegetables are sourced directly from local farmers, ensuring they are fresh, organic, and free from harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li><strong>Dietary Planning Based on Family Size</strong>: We provide personalized dietary plans tailored to your family’s size and nutritional needs. For example, if your family requires 2 kg of potatoes (a carb-rich vegetable) per week, we’ll recommend the right quantity for you.</li>
            <li><strong>Convenience</strong>: With just a few clicks, you can order fresh vegetables tailored to your family’s needs, saving you time and effort.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Our dietary planning feature is designed to make your life easier:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Enter Your Family Size</strong>: Tell us how many members are in your family.</li>
            <li><strong>Get Recommendations</strong>: Based on your family size, we recommend the right quantity of vegetables for each category (carbs, proteins, vitamins, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Order with Confidence</strong>: Add the recommended items to your cart and enjoy fresh, organic produce delivered to your doorstep.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>We envision a world where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Farmers are empowered and rewarded fairly for their hard work.</li>
            <li>Customers have access to fresh, organic produce without the hassle of middlemen.</li>
            <li>Families can maintain a healthy lifestyle with ease, thanks to our dietary planning and delivery services.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Join us in our mission to create a healthier, fairer, and more sustainable food system. Together, we can make a difference—one vegetable at a time.</p>

### 1. Introduction

**1.1 Purpose**  
This SRS document outlines the requirements for the development of a web-based platform that connects users directly with farmers to receive fresh, organic vegetables weekly. The platform aims to ensure cost efficiency, healthy produce for users, and fair benefits for farmers.

**1.2 Scope**  
The platform will allow users to subscribe to weekly vegetable deliveries, suggest quantities based on family size, and provide farmers with an efficient channel to distribute their produce. The system will include features such as user registration, subscription management, order customization, and payment processing.

**1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations**
